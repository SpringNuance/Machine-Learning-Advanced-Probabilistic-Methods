    "There are two bent coins ($c_1$ and $c_2$) with different properties, and your objective is to guess which coin was used (i.e. the value of random variable $C \\in \\{c_1, c_2\\}$), after learning whether the result of the coin toss (i.e. the random variable $X \\in \\{\\mbox{h}, \\mbox{t}\\}$) was heads or tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "As prior knowledge, we know the probability of each coin resulting in tails: $p(X=\\mbox{t} \\mid C=c_1) = \\theta_1$ and $p(X=\\mbox{t} \\mid C=c_2) = \\theta_2$.\n",
    "In addition, the prior probability for using coin $c_1$ is known: $p(C=c_1) = \\pi_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give the posterior probability of coin $c_1$ being used for the toss, $p(C=c_1 \\mid X)$, in terms of $\\theta_1$, $\\theta_2$ and $\\pi_1$, for both $X=\\mbox{t}$ and $X=\\mbox{h}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, plot the posterior probability of coin $c_1$, $p(C=c_1 \\mid X=\\mbox{t})$, as a function of $\\theta_1$, when we have $\\theta_2 = 0.5$ and $\\pi_1 = 0.5$.\n",
